<p class="level0">The screen of Midnight Commander is divided into four parts. Almost all of the screen space is taken up by two directory panels. By default, the second line from the bottom of the screen is the shell command line, and the bottom line shows the function key labels. The topmost line is the </p>
<p class="level0">menu bar line. </p>
<p class="level0">The menu bar line may not be visible, but appears if you click the topmost line with the mouse or press the F9 key. </p>
<p class="level0">Midnight Commander provides a view of two directories at the same time. One of the panels is the current panel (a selection bar is in the current panel). Almost all operations take place on the current panel. Some file operations like Rename and Copy by default use the directory of the unselected panel as a destination (don&#39;t worry, they always ask you for confirmation first). For more information, see the sections on the </p>
<p class="level0">Directory Panels, </p>
<p class="level0">the </p>
<p class="level0">Left and Right Menus </p>
<p class="level0">and the </p>
<p class="level0">File Menu. </p>
<p class="level0">You can execute system commands from Midnight Commander by simply typing them. Everything you type will appear on the shell command line, and when you press Enter, Midnight Commander will execute the command line you typed; read the </p>
<p class="level0">Shell Command Line </p>
<p class="level0">and </p>
<p class="level0">Input Line Keys </p>
<p class="level0">sections to learn more about the command line. </p><a name="Mouse"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">Mouse support</h2>
<p class="level0">Midnight Commander comes with mouse support. It is activated whenever you are running on an <span Class="bold">xterm(1)</span> terminal (it even works if you take a telnet, ssh or rlogin connection to another machine from the xterm) or if you are running on a Linux console and have the <span Class="bold">gpm</span> mouse server running. </p>
<p class="level0">When you left click on a file in the directory panels, that file is selected; if you click with the right button, the file is marked (or unmarked, depending on the previous state). </p>
<p class="level0">Double-clicking on a file will try to execute the command if it is an executable program; and if the </p>
<p class="level0">extension file </p>
<p class="level0">has a program specified for the file&#39;s extension, the specified program is executed. </p>
<p class="level0">Also, it is possible to execute the commands assigned to the function key labels by clicking on them. </p>
<p class="level0">The default auto repeat rate for the mouse buttons is 400 milliseconds. This may be changed to other values by editing the </p>
<p class="level0">~/.config/mc/ini </p>
<p class="level0">file and changing the <span Class="emphasis">mouse_repeat_rate</span> parameter. </p>
<p class="level0">If you are running Midnight Commander with the mouse support, you can get the default mouse behavior (cutting and pasting text) by holding down the Shift key. </p><a name=""></a><h2 class="nroffsh"></h2><a name="Keys"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">Keys</h2>
<p class="level0">Some commands in Midnight Commander involve the use of the <span Class="emphasis">Control</span> (sometimes labeled CTRL or CTL) and the <span Class="emphasis">Meta</span> (sometimes labeled ALT or even Compose) keys. In this manual we will use the following abbreviations: </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">C-&lt;chr&gt;</span> means hold the Control key while typing the character &lt;chr&gt;. Thus C-f would be: hold the Control key and type f. </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">Alt-&lt;chr&gt;</span> means hold the Meta or Alt key down while typing &lt;chr&gt;. If there is no Meta or Alt key, type <span Class="emphasis">Esc</span>, release it, then type the character &lt;chr&gt;. </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">S-&lt;chr&gt;</span> means hold the Shift key down while typing &lt;chr&gt;. </p>
<p class="level0">All input lines in Midnight Commander use an approximation to the GNU Emacs editor&#39;s key bindings (default). </p>
<p class="level0">You may redefine key bindings. See </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">redefine hotkey bindings</span> </p>
<p class="level0">for more info. All other key bindings (described in this manual) are relative to default behavior. </p>
<p class="level0">There are many sections which tell about the keys. The following are the most important. </p>
<p class="level0">The </p>
<p class="level0">File Menu </p>
<p class="level0">section documents the keyboard shortcuts for the commands appearing in the File menu. This section includes the function keys. Most of these commands perform some action, usually on the selected file or the tagged files. </p>
<p class="level0">The </p>
<p class="level0">Directory Panels </p>
<p class="level0">section documents the keys which select a file or tag files as a target for a later action (the action is usually one from the file menu). </p>
<p class="level0">The </p>
<p class="level0">Shell Command Line </p>
<p class="level0">section list the keys which are used for entering and editing command lines. Most of these copy file names and such from the directory panels to the command line (to avoid excessive typing) or access the command line history. </p>
<p class="level0">Input Line Keys </p>
<p class="level0">are used for editing input lines. This means both the command line and the input lines in the query dialogs. </p><a name=""></a><h2 class="nroffsh">  redefine hotkey bindings</h2>
<p class="level0">Hotkey bindings may be read from external file (keymap-file). Initially, Midnight Commander creates key bindings using keymap defined in the source code. Then, two files <span Class="bold">%pkgdatadir%/mc.keymap</span> and <span Class="bold">%sysconfdir%/mc/mc.keymap</span> are loaded always, sequentially reassigned key bindings defined earlier. User-defined keymap-file is searched on the following algorithm (to the first one found): </p>
<p class="level0"><a name=""></a><span class="nroffip"></span> </p>
<p class="level1"><br>1) command line option <span Class="bold">-K &lt;keymap&gt;</span> or <span Class="bold">--keymap=&lt;keymap&gt;</span> <br>2) Environment variable <span Class="bold">MC_KEYMAP</span> <br>3) Parameter <span Class="bold">keymap</span> in section <span Class="bold">[Midnight-Commander]</span> of config file. <br>4) File <span Class="bold">~/.config/mc/mc.keymap</span> <br></p>
<p class="level1">Command line option, environment variable and parameter in config file may contain the absolute path to the keymap-file (with the extension .keymap or without it). Search of keymap-file will occur in (to the first one found): </p>
<p class="level0"><a name=""></a><span class="nroffip"></span> </p>
<p class="level1"><br>1) <span Class="bold">~/.config/mc</span> <br>2) <span Class="bold">%sysconfdir%/mc/</span> <br>3) <span Class="bold">%pkgdatadir%/</span> </p><a name=""></a><h2 class="nroffsh">  miscellaneous keys</h2>
<p class="level0">Here are some keys which don&#39;t fall into any of the other categories: </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">Enter</span> if there is some text in the command line (the one at the bottom of the panels), then that command is executed. If there is no text in the command line then if the selection bar is over a directory the Midnight Commander does a <span Class="bold">chdir(2)</span> to the selected directory and reloads the information on the panel; if the selection is an executable file then it is executed. Finally, if the extension of the selected file name matches one of the extensions in the </p>
<p class="level0">extensions file </p>
<p class="level0">then the corresponding command is executed. </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">C-l</span> repaint all the information in Midnight Commander. </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">C-x c</span> run the </p>
<p class="level0">Chmod </p>
<p class="level0">command on a file or on the tagged files. </p>

<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">C-x h</span> run the </p>
<p class="level0">add directory to hotlist </p>
<p class="level0">command. </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">Alt-!</span> executes the Filtered view command, described in the </p>
<p class="level0">view command. </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">Alt-?</span> executes the </p>
<p class="level0">Find file </p>
<p class="level0">command. </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">Alt-c</span> pops up the </p>

<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">C-o</span> when the program is being run in the Linux or FreeBSD console or under an xterm, it will show you the output of the previous command.  When ran on the Linux console, Midnight Commander uses an external program (cons.saver) to handle saving and restoring of information on the screen. </p>
<p class="level0">When the subshell support is compiled in, you can type C-o at any time and you will be taken back to Midnight Commander&#39;s main screen, to return to your application just type C-o.  If you have an application suspended by using this trick, you won&#39;t be able to execute other programs from Midnight Commander until you terminate the suspended application. </p><a name=""></a><h2 class="nroffsh">  directory panels</h2>
<p class="level0">This section lists the keys which operate on the directory panels. If you want to know how to change the appearance of the panels take a look at the section on </p>
<p class="level0">Left and Right Menus. </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">Tab, C-i</span> change the current panel. The old other panel becomes the new current panel and the old current panel becomes the new other panel. The selection bar moves from the old current panel to the new current panel. </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">Insert, C-t</span> to tag files you may use the Insert key (the kich1 terminfo sequence). To untag files, just retag a tagged file. </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">Alt-e</span> to change charset of panel you may use Alt-e (M-e). Recoding is made from selected codepage into system codepage. To cancel the recoding, select &quot;No translation&quot; in the dialog of encodings. </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">Alt-g, Alt-r, Alt-j</span> used to select the top file in a panel, the middle file and the bottom one, respectively. </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">Alt-t</span> toggle the current display listing to show the next display listing format. With this it is possible to quickly switch to brief listing, long listing, user defined listing format, and back to the default. </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">C-\\\\ (control-backslash)</span> show the </p>
<p class="level0">directory hotlist </p>
<p class="level0">and change to the selected directory. </p>
<p class="level0"><a class="bold" href="#">+ \ (plus)</a> this is used to select (tag) a group of files. Midnight Commander will prompt for a selection options. When <span Class="emphasis">Files only</span> checkbox is on, only files will be selected.  If <span Class="emphasis">Files only</span> is off, as files as directories will be selected. When <span Class="emphasis">Shell Patterns</span> checkbox is on, the regular expression is much like the filename globbing in the shell (* standing for zero or more characters and ? standing for one character). If <span Class="emphasis">Shell Patterns</span> is off, then the tagging of files is done with normal regular expressions (see ed (1)). When <span Class="emphasis">Case sensitive</span> checkbox is on, the selection will be case sensitive characters. If <span Class="emphasis">Case sensitive</span> is off, the case will be ignored. </p>
<p class="level0"><a class="bold" href="#">\\\\ (backslash)</a> use the &quot;&bsol;&quot; key to unselect a group of files. This is the opposite of the Plus key. </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">up-key, C-p</span> move the selection bar to the previous entry in the panel. </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">down-key, C-n</span> move the selection bar to the next entry in the panel. </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">home, a1, Alt-&lt;</span> move the selection bar to the first entry in the panel. </p>

<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">Alt-o</span> If the currently selected file is a directory, load that directory on the other panel and moves the selection to the next file. If the currently selected file is not a directory, load the parent directory on the other panel and moves the selection to the next file. </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">Alt-i</span> make the current directory of the current panel also the current directory of the other panel.  Put the other panel to the listing mode if needed.  If the current panel is panelized, the other panel doesn&#39;t become panelized. </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">C-PageUp, C-PageDown</span> only when supported by the terminal: change to &quot;..&quot; and to the currently selected directory respectively. </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">Alt-y</span> moves to the previous directory in the history, equivalent to clicking the <span Class="emphasis">&lt;</span> with the mouse. </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">Alt-u</span> moves to the next directory in the history, equivalent to clicking the <span Class="emphasis">&gt;</span> with the mouse. </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">Alt-S-h, Alt-H</span> displays the directory history, equivalent to depressing the &#39;v&#39; with the mouse. </p><a name=""></a><h2 class="nroffsh">  quick search</h2>
<p class="level0">The Quick search mode allows you to perform fast file search in file panel. Press <span Class="emphasis">C-s</span> or <span Class="emphasis">Alt-s</span> to start a filename search in the directory listing. </p>
<p class="level0">When the search is active, the user input will be added to the search string instead of the command line. If the <span Class="emphasis">Show mini-status</span> option is enabled the search string is shown on the mini-status line. When typing, the selection bar will move to the next file starting with the typed letters. The <span Class="emphasis">Backspace</span> or <span Class="emphasis">DEL</span> keys can be used to correct typing mistakes. If C-s is pressed again, the next match is searched for. </p>
<p class="level0">If quick search is started with double pressing of C-s, the previous quick search pattern will be used for current search. </p>
<p class="level0">Besides the filename characters, you can also use wildcard characters &#39;*&#39; and &#39;?&#39;. </p><a name=""></a><h2 class="nroffsh">  shell command line</h2>

<p class="level0">lists the actions which allow you to customize Midnight Commander. </p><a name=""></a><h2 class="nroffsh">  left and right (above and below) menus</h2>
<p class="level0">The outlook of the directory panels can be changed from the <span Class="bold">Left</span> and <span Class="bold">Right</span> menus (they are named <span Class="bold">Above</span> and <span Class="bold">Below</span> when the horizontal panel split is chosen from the </p>
<p class="level0">Layout </p>
<p class="level0">options dialog). </p><a name=""></a><h2 class="nroffsh">    listing format...</h2>
<p class="level0">The listing mode view is used to display a listing of files, there are four different listing formats available: <span Class="bold">Full</span>, <span Class="bold">Brief</span>, <span Class="bold">Long</span> and <span Class="bold">User</span>. The full directory view shows the file name, the size of the file and the modification time. </p>
<p class="level0">The brief view shows only the file name and it has from 1 up to 9 columns (therefore showing more files unlike other views). The long view is similar to the output of <span Class="bold">ls -l</span> command. The long view takes the whole screen width. </p>
<p class="level0">If you choose the &quot;User&quot; display format, then you have to specify the display format. </p>
<p class="level0">The user display format must start with a panel size specifier.  This may be &quot;half&quot; or &quot;full&quot;, and they specify a half screen panel and a full screen panel respectively. </p>
<p class="level0">After the panel size, you may specify how many listings to fit in the panel, side-by-side (in other words: how many times to repeat the fields horizontally). This defaults to 1. You may change this by adding a number from 1 to 9 to the format string. </p>
<p class="level0">After this you add the name of the fields with an optional size specifier.  This are the available fields you may display: </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">name</span> displays the file name. </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">size</span> displays the file size. </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">bsize</span> is an alternative form of the <span Class="bold">size</span> format. It displays the size of the files and for directories it just shows SUB-DIR or UP--DIR. </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">type</span> displays a one character wide type field.  This character is similar to what is displayed by ls with the -F flag - <a class="bold" href="#">*</a> for executable files, <a class="bold" href="#">/</a> for directories, <a class="bold" href="#">@</a> for links, <a class="bold" href="#">=</a> for sockets, <span Class="bold">-</span> for character devices, <a class="bold" href="#">+</a> for block devices, <a class="bold" href="#">|</a> for pipes, <a class="bold" href="#">~</a> for symbolic links to directories and <a class="bold" href="#">!</a> for stale symlinks (links that point nowhere). </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">mark</span> an asterisk if the file is tagged, a space if it&#39;s not. </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">mtime</span> file&#39;s last modification time. </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">atime</span> file&#39;s last access time. </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">ctime</span> file&#39;s status change time. </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">perm</span> a string representing the current permission bits of the file. </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">mode</span> an octal value with the current permission bits of the file. </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">nlink</span> the number of links to the file. </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">ngid</span> the GID (numeric). </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">nuid</span> the UID (numeric). </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">owner</span> the owner of the file. </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">group</span> the group of the file. </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">inode</span> the inode of the file. </p>
<p class="level0">Also you can use following keywords to define the panel layout: </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">space</span> a space in the display format. </p>
<p class="level0"><a class="bold" href="#">|</a> add a vertical line to the display format. </p>
<p class="level0">To force one field to a fixed size (a size specifier), you just add <a class="bold" href="#">:</a> followed by the number of characters you want the field to have.  If the number is followed by the symbol <a class="bold" href="#">+</a>, then the size specifies the minimal field size - if the program finds out that there is more space on the screen, it will then expand that field. </p>
<p class="level0">For example, the <span Class="bold">Full</span> display corresponds to this format: </p>
<p class="level0">half type name | size | mtime </p>
<p class="level0">And the <span Class="bold">Long</span> display corresponds to this format: </p>
<p class="level0">full perm space nlink space owner space group space size space mtime space name </p>
<p class="level0">This is a nice user display format: </p>
<p class="level0">half name | size:7 | type mode:3 </p>
<p class="level0">Panels may also be set to the following modes: </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">Info</span> The info view display information related to the currently selected file and if possible information about the current file system. </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">Tree</span> The tree view is quite similar to the </p>
<p class="level0">directory tree </p>
<p class="level0">feature. See the section about it for more information. </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">Quick View</span> In this mode, the panel will switch to a reduced </p>
<p class="level0">viewer </p>
<p class="level0">that displays the contents of the currently selected file, if you select the panel (with the tab key or the mouse), you will have access to the usual viewer commands. </p><a name=""></a><h2 class="nroffsh">    sort order...</h2>
<p class="level0">The eight sort orders are by name, by extension, by modification time, by access time, and by inode information modification time, by size, by inode and unsorted.  In the Sort order dialog box you can choose the sort order and you may also specify if you want to sort in reverse order by checking the reverse box. </p>
<p class="level0">By default directories are sorted before files but this can be changed from the </p>
<p class="level0">Panel options </p>
<p class="level0">menu (option <span Class="bold">Mix all files</span>). </p><a name=""></a><h2 class="nroffsh">    filter...</h2>
<p class="level0">The filter command allows you to specify a shell pattern (for example <span Class="bold">*.tar.gz</span>) which the files and directories must match to be shown. The </p>
<p class="level0">input line </p>
<p class="level0">allow enter the pattern of file/directory names that will be shown in the panel. </p>
<p class="level0">When <span Class="emphasis">Files only</span> checkbox is on, only files will be matched to the filter, and all directories will be shown. Otherwise, as files as directories will be filtered. When <span Class="emphasis">Shell Patterns</span> checkbox is on, the regular expression is much like the filename globbing in the shell (* standing for zero or more characters and ? standing for one character). Otherwise, the matching of files/directoris is done with normal regular expressions (see ed(1)). When <span Class="emphasis">Case sensitive</span> checkbox is on, the filtering will be case sensitive characters. Otherwise, the case will be ignored. </p><a name=""></a><h2 class="nroffsh">    reread</h2>
<p class="level0">The reread command reload the list of files in the directory. It is useful if other processes have created or removed files. </p><a name=""></a><h2 class="nroffsh">  file menu</h2>
<p class="level0">Midnight Commander uses the F1 - F10 keys as keyboard shortcuts for commands appearing in the file menu.  The escape sequences for the function keys are terminfo capabilities kf1 trough kf10.  On terminals without function key support, you can achieve the same functionality by pressing the Esc key and then a number in the range 1 through 9 and 0 (corresponding to F1 to F9 and F10 respectively). </p>
<p class="level0">The File menu has the following commands (keyboard shortcuts in parentheses): </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">Help (F1)</span> </p>
<p class="level0">Invokes the built-in hypertext help viewer. Inside the </p>
<p class="level0">help viewer, </p>
<p class="level0">you can use the Tab key to select the next link and the Enter key to follow that link. The keys Space and Backspace are used to move forward and backward in a help page. Press F1 again to get the full list of accepted keys. </p>
<p class="level0"><a class="bold" href="#Menu">Menu (F2)</a> </p>
<p class="level0">Invoke the </p>
<p class="level0">user menu. </p>
<p class="level0">The user menu provides an easy way to provide users with a menu and add extra features to Midnight Commander. </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">View (F3, F13)</span> </p>
<p class="level0">View the currently selected file. By default this invokes the </p>
<p class="level0">Internal File Viewer </p>
<p class="level0">but if the option &quot;Use internal view&quot; is off, it invokes an external file viewer specified by the <span Class="bold">VIEWER</span> environment variable.  If <span Class="bold">VIEWER</span> is undefined, the <span Class="bold">PAGER</span> environment variable is tried.  If <span Class="bold">PAGER</span> is also undefined, the &quot;view&quot; command is invoked.  If you use F13 instead, the viewer will be invoked without doing any formatting or preprocessing to the file. </p>
<p class="level0">See </p>
<p class="level0">parameters for external viewer </p>
<p class="level0">for explain how you may specify an extended command line options for external viewers. </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">Filtered View (Alt-!)</span> </p>
<p class="level0">This command prompts for a command and its arguments (the argument defaults to the currently selected file name), the output from such command is shown in the internal file viewer. </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">Edit (F4, F14)</span> </p>
<p class="level0">Press F4 to edit the highlighted file.  Press F14 (usually F14) to start the editor with a new, empty file. Currently they invoke the <span Class="bold">vi</span> editor, or the editor specified in the <span Class="bold">EDITOR</span> environment variable, or the </p>
<p class="level0">Internal File Editor </p>
<p class="level0">if the use_internal_edit option is on. </p>
<p class="level0">See </p>
<p class="level0">parameters for external editor </p>
<p class="level0">for explain how you may specify an extended command line options for external editors. </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">Copy (F5, F15)</span> </p>
<p class="level0">Press F5 to pop up an input dialog to copy the currently selected file (or the tagged files, if there is at least one file tagged) to the directory/filename you specify in the input dialog. The destination defaults to the directory in the non-selected panel. Space for destination file may be preallocated relative to preallocate_space configure option. During this process, you can press C-c or Esc to abort the operation. For details about source mask (which will be usually either * or ^&bsol;(.*&bsol;)$ depending on setting of Use shell patterns) and possible wildcards in the destination see </p>
<p class="level0">Mask copy/rename. </p>
<p class="level0">F15 (usually F15) is similar, but defaults to the directory in the selected panel. It always operates on the selected file, regardless of any tagged files. </p>
<p class="level0">On some systems, it is possible to do the copy in the background by clicking on the background button (or pressing Alt-b in the dialog box).  The </p>
<p class="level0">Background Jobs </p>
<p class="level0">is used to control the background process. </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">Link (C-x l)</span> </p>
<p class="level0">Create a hard link to the current file. </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">Absolute symlink (C-x s)</span> </p>
<p class="level0">Create a absolute symbolic link to the current file. </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">Relative symLink (C-x v)</span> </p>
<p class="level0">Create a relative symbolic link to the current file. </p>
<p class="level0">To those of you who don&#39;t know what links are: creating a link to a file is a bit like copying the file, but both the source filename and the destination filename represent the same file image. For example, if you edit one of these files, all changes you make will appear in both files. Some people call links aliases or shortcuts. </p>
<p class="level0">A hard link appears as a real file. After making it, there is no way of telling which one is the original and which is the link. If you delete either one of them the other one is still intact. It is very difficult to notice that the files represent the same image. Use hard links when you don&#39;t even want to know. </p>
<p class="level0">A symbolic link is a reference to the name of the original file. If the original file is deleted the symbolic link is useless. It is quite easy to notice that the files represent the same image. Midnight Commander shows an &quot;@&quot;-sign in front of the file name if it is a symbolic link to somewhere (except to directory, where it shows a tilde (~)). The original file which the link points to is shown on mini-status line if the <span Class="emphasis">Show mini-status</span> option is enabled. Use symbolic links when you want to avoid the confusion that can be caused by hard links. </p>
<p class="level0">When you press &quot;C-x s&quot; Midnight Commander will automatically fill in the complete path+filename of the original file and suggest a name for the link. You can change either one. </p>
<p class="level0">Sometimes you may want to change the absolute path of the original into a relative path. An absolute path starts from the root directory: </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">/home/frodo/mc/mc -&gt; /home/frodo/new/mc</span> </p>
<p class="level0">A relative link describes the original file&#39;s location starting from the location of the link itself: </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">/home/frodo/mc/mc -&gt; ../new/mc</span> </p>
<p class="level0">You can force Midnight Commander to suggest a relative path by pressing &quot;C-x v&quot; instead of &quot;C-x s&quot;. </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">Rename/Move (F6, F16)</span> </p>
<p class="level0">Press F6 to pop up an input dialog to copy the currently selected file (or the tagged files, if there is at least one file tagged) to the directory/filename you specify in the input dialog.  The destination defaults to the directory in the non-selected panel. For more details look at Copy (F5) operation above, most of the things are quite similar. </p>
<p class="level0">F16 (usually F16) is similar, but defaults to the directory in the selected panel. It always operates on the selected file, regardless of any tagged files. </p>
<p class="level0">On some systems, it is possible to do the copy in the background by clicking on the background button (or pressing Alt-b in the dialog box).  The </p>

<p class="level0">Pop up an input dialog and creates the directory specified. </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">Delete (F8)</span> </p>
<p class="level0">Delete the currently selected file or the tagged files in the currently selected panel. During the process, you can press C-c or Esc to abort the operation. </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">Quick cd (Alt-c)</span> Use the </p>
<p class="level0">quick cd </p>
<p class="level0">command if you have full command line and want to cd somewhere. </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">Select group (+)</span> </p>
<p class="level0">This is used to select (tag) a group of files. Midnight Commander will prompt for a selection options. When <span Class="emphasis">Files only</span> checkbox is on, only files will be selected.  If <span Class="emphasis">Files only</span> is off, as files as directories will be selected. When <span Class="emphasis">Shell Patterns</span> checkbox is on, the regular expression is much like the filename globbing in the shell (* standing for zero or more characters and ?  standing for one character). If <span Class="emphasis">Shell Patterns</span> is off, then the tagging of files is done with normal regular expressions (see ed (1)). When <span Class="emphasis">Case sensitive</span> checkbox is on, the selection will be case sensitive characters. If <span Class="emphasis">Case sensitive</span> is off, the case will be ignored. </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">Unselect group (\\\\)</span> </p>
<p class="level0">Used to unselect a group of files. This is the opposite of the <span Class="emphasis">Select group</span> command. </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">Quit (F10, S-F10)</span> </p>
<p class="level0">Terminate Midnight Commander. S-F10 is used when you want to quit and you are using the shell wrapper.  S-F10 will not take you to the last directory you visited with Midnight Commander, instead it will stay at the directory where you started Midnight Commander. </p><a name=""></a><h2 class="nroffsh">    quick cd</h2>

<p class="level0">command allows you to search for a specific file. </p>
<p class="level0">The &quot;Swap panels&quot; command swaps the contents of the two directory panels. </p>
<p class="level0">The &quot;Switch panels on/off&quot; command shows the output of the last shell command. This works only on xterm and on Linux and FreeBSD console. </p>
<p class="level0">The &quot;Compare directories&quot; command compares the directory panels with each other. You can then use the Copy (F5) command to make the panels identical. There are three compare methods. The quick method compares only file size and file date. The thorough method makes a full byte-by-byte compare. The thorough method is not available if the machine does not support the mmap(2) system call.  The size-only compare method just compares the file sizes and does not check the contents or the date times, it just checks the file size. </p>
<p class="level0">The </p>

<p class="level0">The Directory Tree command shows a tree figure of the directories. You can select a directory from the figure and Midnight Commander will change to that directory. </p>
<p class="level0">There are two ways to invoke the tree. The real directory tree command is available from Commands menu. The other way is to select tree view from the Left or Right menu. </p>
<p class="level0">To get rid of long delays, Midnight Commander creates the tree figure by scanning only a small subset of all the directories. If the directory which you want to see is missing, move to its parent directory and press C-r (or F2). </p>
<p class="level0">You can use the following keys: </p>
<p class="level0">General movement keys </p>
<p class="level0">are accepted. </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">Enter.</span> In the directory tree, exits the directory tree and changes to this directory in the current panel. In the tree view, changes to this directory in the other panel and stays in tree view mode in the current panel. </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">C-r, F2 (Rescan).</span> Rescan this directory. Use this when the tree figure is out of date: it is missing subdirectories or shows some subdirectories which don&#39;t exist any more. </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">F3 (Forget).</span> Delete this directory from the tree figure. Use this to remove clutter from the figure. If you want the directory back to the tree figure press F2 in its parent directory. </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">F4 (Static/Dynamic).</span> Toggle between the dynamic navigation mode (default) and the static navigation mode. </p>
<p class="level0">In the static navigation mode you can use the Up and Down keys to select a directory. All known directories are shown. </p>
<p class="level0">In the dynamic navigation mode you can use the Up and Down keys to select a sibling directory, the Left key to move to the parent directory, and the Right key to move to a child directory. Only the parent, sibling and children directories are shown, others are left out. The tree figure changes dynamically as you traverse. </p>

<p class="level0">The Find File feature first asks for the start directory for the search and the filename to be searched for. By pressing the Tree button you can select the start directory from the </p>
<p class="level0">directory tree </p>
<p class="level0">figure. </p>
<p class="level0">The &quot;File name&quot; input field contains a filename pattern to be searched for. It is interpreted as a shell pattern or as a regular expression depending on the state of the &quot;Using shell patterns&quot; checkbox. An empty value is valid and matches any file name. </p>
<p class="level0">The &quot;Content&quot; input field contains a string to search for within the files. Leave this field empty to disable searching file contents. </p>
<p class="level0">Option &quot;Whole words&quot; allows select only those files containing matches that form whole words. Like grep -w. </p>
<p class="level0">You can start the search by pressing the OK button. During the search you can stop from the Stop button and continue from the Start button. </p>
<p class="level0">You can browse the filelist with the up and down arrow keys. The Chdir button will change to the directory of the currently selected file. The Again button will ask for the parameters for a new search. The Quit button quits the search operation. The Panelize button will place the found files to the current directory panel so that you can do additional operations on them (view, copy, move, delete and so on). To return to the normal file listing, change directory to &quot;..&quot;. </p>
<p class="level0">The &#39;Enable ignore directories&#39; checkbox and input field below it allow one to set up the list of directories that should be skip during the search files (for example, you may want to avoid searches on a CD-ROM or on a NFS directory that is mounted across a slow link). List components must be separated with a colon, here is an example: </p><pre class="level0">
/cdrom:/nfs/wuarchive:/afs
</pre>

<p class="level0">Relative paths are supported also. The following example shows how to skip special directories of version control systems: </p><pre class="level0">
/cdrom:/nfs/wuarchive:/afs:.svn:.git:CVS
</pre>

<p class="level0">Attention: input field can contain a dot (.), this means the current absolute path. </p>
<p class="level0">You may consider using the </p>
<p class="level0">External panelize </p>
<p class="level0">command for some operations. Find file command is for simple queries only, while using External panelize you can do as mysterious searches as you would like. </p><a name=""></a><h2 class="nroffsh">    external panelize</h2>
<p class="level0">The External panelize allows you to execute an external program, and make the output of that program the contents of the current panel. </p>
<p class="level0">For example, if you want to manipulate in one of the panels all the symbolic links in the current directory, you can use external panelization to run the following command: </p><pre class="level0">
find . -type l -print
</pre>

<p class="level0">Upon command completion, the directory contents of the panel will no longer be the directory listing of the current directory, but all the files that are symbolic links. </p>
<p class="level0">If you want to panelize all of the files that have been downloaded from your FTP server, you can use this awk command to extract the file name from the transfer log files: </p><pre class="level0">
awk &#39;$9 ~! /incoming/ { print $9 }&#39; &lt; /var/log/xferlog
</pre>

<p class="level0">You may want to save often used panelize commands under a descriptive name, so that you can recall them quickly. You do this by typing the command on the input line and pressing Add new button. Then you enter a name under which you want the command to be saved. Next time, you just choose that command from the list and do not have to type it again. </p><a name=""></a><h2 class="nroffsh">    hotlist</h2>
<p class="level0">The Directory hotlist command shows the labels of the directories in the directory hotlist. Midnight Commander will change to the directory corresponding to the selected label.  From the hotlist dialog, you can remove already created label/directory pairs and add new ones. To add new directories quickly, you can use the Add to hotlist command (C-x h), which adds the current directory into the directory hotlist, asking just for the label for the directory. </p>
<p class="level0">This makes cd to often used directories faster. You may consider using the CDPATH variable as described in </p>

<p class="level0">This will invoke your editor on the file <span Class="emphasis">~/.config/mc/mc.ext.ini</span>. If this file does not exist and you are not root, it will be copied from <span Class="emphasis">%sysconfdir%/mc/mc.ext.ini</span>. If you are root, you can choose the file to edit: user&#39;s <span Class="emphasis">~/.config/mc/mc.ext.ini</span> or system-wide <span Class="emphasis">%sysconfdir%/mc/mc.ext.ini</span>. The format of this file is described in detail in it. </p><a name=""></a><h2 class="nroffsh">    background jobs</h2>
<p class="level0">This lets you control the state of any background Midnight Commander process (only copy and move files operations can be done in the background).  You can stop, restart and kill a background job from here. </p><a name=""></a><h2 class="nroffsh">    edit menu file</h2>
<p class="level0">The user menu is a menu of useful actions that can be customized by the user. When you access the user menu, the file .mc.menu from the current directory is used if it exists, but only if it is owned by user or root and is not world-writable. If no such file found, ~/.config/mc/menu is tried in the same way, and otherwise mc uses the default system-wide menu %pkgdatadir%/mc.menu. </p>
<p class="level0">The format of the menu file is very simple. Lines that start with anything but space or tab are considered entries for the menu (in order to be able to use it like a hot key, the first character should be a letter). All the lines that start with a space or a tab are the commands that will be executed when the entry is selected. </p>
<p class="level0">When an option is selected all the command lines of the option are copied to a temporary file in the temporary directory (usually /usr/tmp) and then that file is executed. This allows the user to put normal shell constructs in the menus. Also simple macro substitution takes place before executing the menu code. For more information, see </p>
<p class="level0">macro substitution. </p>
<p class="level0">Here is a sample mc.menu file: </p><pre class="level0">
A	Dump the currently selected file
	od -c %f
&nbsp;
B	Edit a bug report and send it to root
	I=`mktemp ${MC_TMPDIR:-/tmp}/mail.XXXXXX` || exit 1
	vi $I
	mail -s &quot;Midnight Commander bug&quot; root &lt; $I

<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">Default Conditions</span> </p>
<p class="level0">Each menu entry may be preceded by a condition. The condition must start from the first column with a &#39;=&#39; character. If the condition is true, the menu entry will be the default entry. </p><pre class="level0">
Condition syntax: 	= &lt;sub-cond&gt;
&nbsp; or:			= &lt;sub-cond&gt; | &lt;sub-cond&gt; ...
&nbsp; or:			= &lt;sub-cond&gt; &amp; &lt;sub-cond&gt; ...
&nbsp;
Sub-condition is one of following:
&nbsp;
&nbsp; y &lt;pattern&gt;		syntax of current file matching pattern?
			(for edit menu only)
&nbsp; f &lt;pattern&gt;		current file matching pattern?
&nbsp; F &lt;pattern&gt;		other file matching pattern?
&nbsp; d &lt;pattern&gt;		current directory matching pattern?
&nbsp; D &lt;pattern&gt;		other directory matching pattern?
&nbsp; t &lt;type&gt;		current file of type?
&nbsp; T &lt;type&gt;		other file of type?
&nbsp; x &lt;filename&gt;		is it executable filename?
&nbsp; ! &lt;sub-cond&gt;		negate the result of sub-condition
</pre>

<p class="level0">Pattern is a normal shell pattern or a regular expression, according to the shell patterns option. You can override the global value of the shell patterns option by writing &quot;shell_patterns=x&quot; on the first line of the menu file (where &quot;x&quot; is either 0 or 1). </p>
<p class="level0">Type is one or more of the following characters: </p><pre class="level0">
&nbsp; n	not a directory
&nbsp; r	regular file
&nbsp; d	directory
&nbsp; l	link
&nbsp; c	character device
&nbsp; b	block device
&nbsp; f	FIFO (pipe)
&nbsp; s	socket
&nbsp; x	executable file
&nbsp; t	tagged
</pre>

<p class="level0">For example &#39;rlf&#39; means either regular file, link or fifo. The &#39;t&#39; type is a little special because it acts on the panel instead of the file. The condition &#39;=t t&#39; is true if there are tagged files in the current panel and false if not. </p>
<p class="level0">If the condition starts with &#39;=?&#39; instead of &#39;=&#39; a debug trace will be shown whenever the value of the condition is calculated. </p>
<p class="level0">The conditions are calculated from left to right. This means </p><pre class="level0">
	= f *.tar.gz | f *.tgz &amp; t n
</pre>

<p class="level0">is calculated as </p><pre class="level0">
	( (f *.tar.gz) | (f *.tgz) ) &amp; (t n)
</pre>

<p class="level0">Here is a sample of the use of conditions: </p><pre class="level0">
= f *.tar.gz | f *.tgz &amp; t n
L	List the contents of a compressed tar-archive
	gzip -cd %f | tar xvf -
</pre>

<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">Addition Conditions</span> </p>
<p class="level0">If the condition begins with &#39;+&#39; (or &#39;+?&#39;) instead of &#39;=&#39; (or &#39;=?&#39;) it is an addition condition. If the condition is true the menu entry will be included in the menu. If the condition is false the menu entry will not be included in the menu. </p>
<p class="level0">You can combine default and addition conditions by starting condition with &#39;+=&#39; or &#39;=+&#39; (or &#39;+=?&#39; or &#39;=+?&#39; if you want debug trace). If you want to use two different conditions, one for adding and another for defaulting, you can precede a menu entry with two condition lines, one starting with &#39;+&#39; and another starting with &#39;=&#39;. </p>
<p class="level0">Comments are started with &#39;&#35;&#39;. The additional comment lines must start with &#39;&#35;&#39;, space or tab. </p><a name=""></a><h2 class="nroffsh">  options menu</h2>
<p class="level0">Midnight Commander has some options that may be toggled on and off in several dialogs which are accessible from this menu. Options are enabled if they have an asterisk or &quot;x&quot; in front of them. </p>

<p class="level0">The options in this dialog are divided into several groups: &quot;File operation options&quot;, &quot;Esc key mode&quot;, &quot;Pause after run&quot; and &quot;Other options&quot;. </p>
<p class="level0"><a class="bold" href="#File">File operation options</a> </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">Verbose operation.</span> This toggles whether the file Copy, Rename and Delete operations are verbose (i.e., display a dialog box for each operation). If you have a slow terminal, you may wish to disable the verbose operation. It is automatically turned off if the speed of your terminal is less than 9600 bps. </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">Compute totals.</span> If this option is enabled, Midnight Commander computes total byte sizes and total number of files prior to any Copy, Rename and Delete operations. This will provide you with a more accurate progress bar at the expense of some speed. This option has no effect, if <span Class="emphasis">Verbose  operation</span> is disabled. </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">Classic progressbar.</span> If this option is enabled, the progressbar of Copy/Move/Delete operations is always grown form left to right. If disabled, the growing direction of progressbar follows to direction of Copy/Move/Delete operation: from left panel to right one and vice versa. Enabled by default. </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">Mkdir autoname.</span> When you press F7 to create a new directory, the input line in popup dialog will be filled by name of current file or directory in active panel. Disabled by default. </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">Preallocate space.</span> Preallocate space for whole target file, if possible, before copy operation. Disabled by default. </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">Esc key mode.</span> </p>
<p class="level0">By default, Midnight Commander treats the Esc key as a key prefix. Therefore, you should press Esc code twice to exit a dialog. But there is a possibility to use a single press of Esc key for that action. </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">Single press.</span> By default this option is disabled. If you&#39;ll enable it, the Esc key will act as a prefix key for set up time interval (see <span Class="emphasis">Timeout</span> option below), and if no extra keys have arrived, then the Esc key is interpreted as a cancel key (Esc Esc). </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">Timeout.</span> This options is used to setup the time interval (in microseconds) for single press of Esc key. By default, this interval is one second (1000000 microseconds). Also the timeout can be set via KEYBOARD_KEY_TIMEOUT_US environment variable (also in microseconds), which has higher priority than Timeout option value. </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">Pause after run</span> </p>
<p class="level0">After executing your commands, Midnight Commander can pause, so that you can examine the output of the command.  There are three possible settings for this variable: </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">Never.</span> Means that you do not want to see the output of your command.  If you are using the Linux or FreeBSD console or an xterm, you will be able to see the output of the command by typing C-o. </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">On dumb terminals.</span> You will get the pause message on terminals that are not capable of showing the output of the last command executed (any terminal that is not an xterm or the Linux console). </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">Always.</span> The program will pause after executing all of your commands. </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">Other options</span> </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">Use internal editor.</span> If this option is enabled, the built-in file editor is used to edit files. If the option is disabled, the editor specified in the <span Class="bold">EDITOR</span> environment variable is used. If no editor is specified, <span Class="bold">vi</span> is used.  See the section on the </p>
<p class="level0">internal file editor. </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">Use internal viewer.</span> If this option is enabled, the built-in file viewer is used to view files. If the option is disabled, the pager specified in the <span Class="bold">PAGER</span> environment variable is used. If no pager is specified, the <span Class="bold">view</span> command is used.  See the section on the </p>
<p class="level0">internal file viewer. </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">Ask new file name.</span> If this option is enabled, file name is asked before open new file in editor. </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">Auto menus.</span> If this option is enabled, the user menu will be invoked at startup. Useful for building menus for non-unixers. </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">Drop down menus.</span> When this option is enabled, the pull down menus will be activated as soon as you press the F9 key. Otherwise, you will only get the menu title, and you will have to activate the menu either with the arrow keys or with the hotkeys. It is recommended if you are using hotkeys. </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">Shell Patterns.</span> By default the Select, Unselect and Filter commands will use shell-like regular expressions. The following conversions are performed to achieve this: the &#39;*&#39; is replaced by &#39;.*&#39; (zero or more characters); the &#39;?&#39; is replaced by &#39;.&#39; (exactly one character) and &#39;.&#39; by the literal dot. If the option is disabled, then the regular expressions are the ones described in ed(1). </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">Complete: show all.</span> By default, Midnight Commander pops up all possible </p>
<p class="level0">completions </p>
<p class="level0">if the completion is ambiguous only when you press <span Class="bold">Alt-Tab</span> for the second time.  For the first time, it just completes as much as possible and beeps in the case of ambiguity.  Enable this option if you want to see all possible completions even after pressing <span Class="bold">Alt-Tab</span> the first time. </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">Rotating dash.</span> If this option is enabled, the Midnight Commander shows a rotating dash in the upper right corner as a work in progress indicator. </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">Cd follows links.</span> This option, if set, causes Midnight Commander to follow the logical chain of directories when changing current directory either in the panels, or using the cd command. This is the default behavior of bash. When unset, Midnight Commander follows the real directory structure, so cd .. if you&#39;ve entered that directory through a link will move you to the current directory&#39;s real parent and not to the directory where the link was present. </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">Safe delete.</span> If this option is enabled, deleting files and directory hotlist entries unintentionally becomes more difficult.  The default selection in the confirmation dialogs for deletion changes from <span Class="bold">Yes</span> to <span Class="bold">No</span>. This option is disabled by default. </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">Safe overwrite.</span> If this option is enabled, overwriting files unintentionally becomes more difficult.  The default selection in the overwrite confirmation dialog changes from <span Class="bold">Yes</span> to <span Class="bold">No</span>. This option is disabled by default. </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">Auto save setup.</span> If this option is enabled, when you exit Midnight Commander, the configurable options of Midnight Commander are saved in the ~/.config/mc/ini file. </p><a name=""></a><h2 class="nroffsh">    layout</h2>
<p class="level0">The layout dialog gives you a possibility to change the general layout of screen. The options in this dialog are divided into several groups: &quot;Panel split&quot;, &quot;Console output&quot; and &quot;Other options&quot;. </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">Panel split</span> </p>
<p class="level0">The rest of the screen area is used for the two directory panels. You can specify whether the area is split to the panels in <span Class="emphasis">Vertical</span> or <span Class="emphasis">Horizontal</span> direction. Panel layout can be changed using Alt-, (Alt-comma) shortcut. </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">Equal split.</span> By default, panels have equal sizes. Using this option you can specify an unequal split. </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">Console output</span> </p>
<p class="level0">On the Linux or FreeBSD console you can specify how many lines are shown in the output window. This option is available if Midnight Commander runs on native console only. </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">Other options</span> </p>
<p class="level0"><a class="emphasis" href="#Menu">Menu bar visible.</a> If enabled, main menu of Midnight Commander is always visible on the top row of screen above panels. Enabled by default. </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">Command prompt.</span> If enabled, command line is available. Enabled by default. </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">Keybar visible.</span> If enabled, 10 labels associated with F1-F10 keys are located at the bottom row of screen. Enabled by default. </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">Hintbar visible.</span> If enabled, the one-line hints are visible below panels. Enabled by default. </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">XTerm window title.</span> When run in a terminal emulator for X11, Midnight Commander sets the terminal window title to the current working directory and updates it when necessary.  If your terminal emulator is broken and you see some incorrect output on startup and directory change, turn off this option. Enabled by default. </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">Show free space.</span> If enabled, free space and total space of current file system is shown at the bottom frame of panel. Enabled by default. </p><a name=""></a><h2 class="nroffsh">    panel options</h2>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">Main panel options</span> </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">Show mini-status.</span> If enabled, one line of status information about the currently selected item is shown at the bottom of the panels. Enabled by default. </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">Use SI size units.</span> If this option is enabled, Midnight Commander will use SI prefixes (base 10) when displaying any byte sizes. If disabled (default), Midnight Commander will use IEC prefixes (base 2). </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">Mix all files.</span> If this option is enabled, all files and directories are shown mixed together.  If the option is disabled (default), directories (and links to directories) are shown at the beginning of the listing, and other files below. </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">Show backup files.</span> If enabled, Midnight Commander will show files ending with a tilde. Otherwise, they won&#39;t be shown (like GNU&#39;s ls option -B). Enabled by default. </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">Show hidden files.</span> If enabled, Midnight Commander will show all files that start with a dot (like ls -a). Disabled by default. </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">Fast directory reload.</span> If this option is enabled, Midnight Commander will use a trick to determine if the directory contents have changed.  The trick is to reload the directory only if the i-node of the directory has changed; this means that reloads only happen when files are created or deleted.  If what changes is the i-node for a file in the directory (file size changes, mode or owner changes, etc) the display is not updated.  In these cases, if you have the option on, you have to rescan the directory manually (with C-r). Disabled by default. </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">Mark moves down.</span> If enabled, the selection bar will move down when you mark a file (with Insert key). Enabled by default. </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">Reverse files only.</span> Allow revert selection of files only. Enabled by default. If enabled, the reverse selection is applied to files only, not to directories. The selection of directories is untouched. If off, the reverse selection is applied to files as well to directories: all unselected items become selected, and vice versa. </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">Simple swap.</span> If both panels contain file listing, simple swap means that panels exchange its screen positions: left panel become right one, and vice versa. If this option is unchecked, file listing panels exchange its content keeping listing format and sort options. Unchecked by default. </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">Auto save panels setup.</span> If this option is enabled, when you exit Midnight Commander, the current settings of panels are saved in the ~/.config/mc/panels.ini file. Disabled by default. </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">Navigation</span> </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">Lynx-like motion.</span> If this option is enabled, you may use the arrows keys to automatically chdir if the current selection is a subdirectory and the shell command line is empty. By default, this setting is off. </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">Page scrolling.</span> If set (the default), panel will scroll by half the display when the cursor reaches the end or the beginning of the panel, otherwise it will just scroll a file at a time. </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">Center scrolling.</span> If set, panel will scroll when the cursor reaches the middle of the panel column, only hitting the top or bottom of the panel when actually on the first or last file. This behavior applies when scrolling one file at a time, and does not apply to the page up/down keys. </p>
<p class="level0"><a class="emphasis" href="#Mouse">Mouse page scrolling.</a> Controls whenever scrolling with the mouse wheel is done by pages or line by line on the panels. </p>
<p class="level0"><a class="bold" href="#File">File highlight</a> </p>
<p class="level0">You can specify whether <span Class="emphasis">permissions</span> and <span Class="emphasis">file types</span> should be highlighted with distinctive </p>

<p class="level0">This is used to configure the range of visible characters on the screen.  This setting may be 7-bits if your terminal/curses supports only seven output bits, ISO-8859-1 displays all the characters in the ISO-8859-1 map and full 8 bits is for those terminals that can display full 8 bit characters. </p><a name=""></a><h2 class="nroffsh">    learn keys</h2>
<p class="level0">This dialog allows you to test and redefine functional keys, cursor arrows and some other keys to make them work properly on your terminal. They often don&#39;t, since many terminal databases are incomplete or broken. </p>
<p class="level0">You can move around with the Tab key and with the vi moving keys (&#39;h&#39; left, &#39;j&#39; down, &#39;k&#39; up and &#39;l&#39; right).  Once you press any cursor movement key and it is recognized, you can use that key as well. </p>
<p class="level0">You can test keys just by pressing each of them.  When you press a key and it is recognized properly, OK should appear next to the name of that key.  Once a key is marked OK it starts working as usually, e.g. F1 pressed the first time will just check that the F1 key works, but after that it will show help.  The same applies to the arrow keys. The Tab key should be working always. </p>
<p class="level0">If some keys do not work properly then you won&#39;t see OK appear after pressing one of these.  Then you may want to redefine it.  Do it by pressing the button with the name of that key (either by the mouse or by Enter or Space after selecting the button with Tab or arrows).  Then a message box will appear asking you to press that key.  Do it and wait until the message box disappears.  If you want to abort, just press Escape once and wait. </p>
<p class="level0">When you finish with all the keys, you can Save them.  The definitions for the keys you have redefined will be written into the [terminal:TERM] section of your ~/.config/mc/ini file (where TERM is the name of your current terminal).  The definitions of the keys that were already working properly are not saved. </p><a name=""></a><h2 class="nroffsh">    virtual fs</h2>
<p class="level0">This option gives you control over the settings of the </p>
<p class="level0">Virtual File System. </p>
<p class="level0">Midnight Commander keeps in memory the information related to some of the virtual file systems to speed up the access to the files in the file system (for example, directory listings fetched from FTP servers). </p>
<p class="level0">Also, in order to access the contents of compressed files (for example, compressed tar files), Midnight Commander needs to create temporary uncompressed files on your disk. </p>
<p class="level0">Since both the information in memory and the temporary files on disk take up resources, you may want to tune the parameters of the cached information to decrease your resource usage or to maximize the speed of access to frequently used file systems. </p>
<p class="level0">Because of the format of the tar archives, the <span Class="emphasis">Tar filesystem</span> needs to read the whole file just to load the file entries.  Since most tar files are usually kept compressed (plain tar files are species in extinction), the tar file system has to uncompress the file on the disk in a temporary location and then access the uncompressed file as a regular tar file. </p>
<p class="level0">Now, since we all love to browse files and tar files all over the disk, it&#39;s common that you will leave a tar file and then re-enter it later. Since decompression is slow, Midnight Commander will cache the information in memory for a limited time.  When the timeout expires, all the resources associated with the file system are released.  The default timeout is set to one minute. </p>
<p class="level0">The </p>
<p class="level0">FTP File System </p>
<p class="level0">(ftpfs) allows you to browse directories on remote FTP servers.  It has several options. </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">ftp anonymous password</span> is the password used when you login as &quot;anonymous&quot;.  Some sites require a valid e-mail address.  On the other hand, you probably don&#39;t want to give your real e-mail address to untrusted sites, especially if you are not using spam filtering. </p>
<p class="level0">ftpfs keeps the directory listing it fetches from a FTP server in a cache. The cache expire time is configurable with the <span Class="emphasis">ftpfs directory cache timeout</span> option.  A low value for this option may slow down every operation on the ftpfs because every operation would require sending a request to the FTP server. </p>
<p class="level0">You can define an FTP proxy host for doing FTP.  Note that most modern firewalls are fully transparent at least for passive FTP (see below), so FTP proxies are considered obsolete. </p>
<p class="level0">If <span Class="emphasis">Always use ftp proxy</span> is not set, you can use the exclamation sign to enable proxy for certain hosts.  See </p>

<p class="level0">If this option is set, the program will do two things: consult the %sysconfdir%/mc/mc.no_proxy file for lines containing host names that are local (if the host name starts with a dot, it is assumed to be a domain) and to assume that any hostnames without dots in their names are directly accessible.  All other hosts will be accessed through the specified FTP proxy. </p>

<p class="level0">At startup, Midnight Commander tries to load initialization information from the ~/.config/mc/ini file. If this file doesn&#39;t exist, the system-wide file <span Class="bold">%sysconfdir%/mc/mc.ini</span> is used. If this file doesn&#39;t exist, the system-wide file <span Class="bold">%pkgdatadir%/mc.ini</span> is used. If this file doesn&#39;t exist, MC uses the default settings. </p>

<p class="level0">You may execute commands by typing them directly in Midnight Commander&#39;s input line, or by selecting the program you want to execute with the selection bar in one of the panels and hitting Enter. </p>
<p class="level0">If you press Enter over a file that is not executable, Midnight Commander checks the extension of the selected file against the extensions in the </p>
<p class="level0">Extensions File. </p>
<p class="level0">If a match is found then the code associated with that extension is executed. A very simple </p>

<p class="level0">The <span Class="emphasis">cd</span> command is interpreted by Midnight Commander, it is not passed to the command shell for execution.  Thus it may not handle all of the nice macro expansion and substitution that your shell does, although it does some of them: </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">Tilde substitution.</span> The (~) will be substituted with your home directory, if you append a username after the tilde, then it will be substituted with the login directory of the specified user. </p>
<p class="level0">For example, ~guest is the home directory for the user guest, while ~/guest is the directory guest in your home directory. </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">Previous directory.</span> You can jump to the directory you were previously by using the special directory name &#39;-&#39; like this: <span Class="bold">cd -</span> </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">CDPATH directories.</span> If the directory specified to the <span Class="bold">cd</span> command is not in the current directory, then Midnight Commander uses the value in the environment variable <span Class="bold">CDPATH</span> to search for the directory in any of the named directories. </p>
<p class="level0">For example you could set your <span Class="bold">CDPATH</span> variable to ~/src:/usr/src, allowing you to change your directory to any of the directories inside the ~/src and /usr/src directories, from any place in the file system by using its relative name (for example cd linux could take you to /usr/src/linux). </p><a name=""></a><h2 class="nroffsh">  macro substitution</h2>

<p class="level0">The subshell support is a compile time option, that works with the shells: bash, ash (BusyBox and Debian), tcsh, zsh and fish. </p>
<p class="level0">When the subshell support is active, Midnight Commander will spawn a concurrent copy of your shell (the one defined in the <span Class="bold">SHELL</span> variable and if it is not defined, then the one in the /etc/passwd file) and run it in a pseudo terminal, instead of invoking a new shell each time you execute a command, the command will be passed to the subshell as if you had typed it.  This also allows you to change the environment variables, use shell functions and define aliases that are valid until you quit Midnight Commander. </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">bash</span> users may specify startup commands in ~/.local/share/mc/bashrc (fallback ~/.bashrc) and special keyboard maps in ~/.local/share/mc/inputrc (fallback ~/.inputrc). </p>

<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">tcsh, fish</span> users cannot specify mc-specific startup commands at present. They have to rely on shell-specific startup files. </p>
<p class="level0">The following paragraphs are relevant only when the subshell support is active: </p>
<p class="level0">You can suspend applications at any time with the sequence C-o and jump back to Midnight Commander, if you interrupt an application, you will not be able to run other external commands until you quit the application you interrupted. </p>
<p class="level0">The basic prompt displayed by Midnight Commander is of the form &quot;user@host:current_path$ &quot;. When using a capable shell, like Bash, the prompt displayed by Midnight Commander will be the same prompt that you are currently using in your shell. </p>

<p class="level0">When you copy, move or delete files, Midnight Commander shows the file operations dialog.  It shows the files currently being processed and uses up to three progress bars.  The file bar indicates the percentage of the current file that has been processed so far.  The count bar shows how many of the tagged files have been handled.  The bytes bar indicates the percentage of the total size of the tagged files that has been handled.  If the verbose option is off, the file and bytes bars are not shown. </p>
<p class="level0">There are two buttons at the bottom of the dialog. Pressing the Skip button will skip the rest of the current file. Pressing the Abort button will abort the whole operation, the rest of the files are skipped. </p>
<p class="level0">There are three other dialogs which you can run into during the file operations. </p>
<p class="level0">The error dialog informs about error conditions and has three choices. Normally you select either the Skip button to skip the file or the Abort button to abort the operation altogether.  You can also select the Retry button if you fixed the problem from another terminal. </p>
<p class="level0">The replace dialog is shown when you attempt to copy or move a file on the top of an existing file.  The dialog shows the dates and sizes of the both files.  Press the Yes button to overwrite the file, the No button to skip the file, the All button to overwrite all the files, the None button to never overwrite and the Update button to overwrite if the source file is newer than the target file.  You can abort the whole operation by pressing the Abort button. </p>
<p class="level0">The recursive delete dialog is shown when you try to delete a directory which is not empty.  Press the Yes button to delete the directory recursively, the No button to skip the directory, the All button to delete all the directories and the None button to skip all the non-empty directories.  You can abort the whole operation by pressing the Abort button.  If you selected the Yes or All button you will be asked for a confirmation.  Type &quot;yes&quot; only if you are really sure you want to do the recursive delete. </p>
<p class="level0">If you have tagged files and perform an operation on them only the files on which the operation succeeded are untagged. Failed and skipped files are left tagged. </p><a name="Mask"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">Mask copy/rename</h2>
<p class="level0">The copy/move operations let you translate the names of files in an easy way.  To do it, you have to specify the correct source mask and usually in the trailing part of the destination specify some wildcards. All the files matching the source mask are copied/renamed according to the target mask.  If there are tagged files, only the tagged files matching the source mask are renamed. </p>
<p class="level0">There are other options which you can set: </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">Follow links</span> </p>
<p class="level0">determines whether make the symlinks and hardlinks in the source directory (recursively in subdirectories) new links in the target directory or whether would you like to copy their content. </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">Dive into subdirs</span> </p>
<p class="level0">determines the behavior when the source directory is about to be copied, but the target directory already exists.  The default action is to copy the contents of the source directory into the target directory. Enabling this option causes copying the source directory itself into the target directory. </p>
<p class="level0">For example, you want to copy directory <span Class="emphasis">/foo</span> containing file <span Class="emphasis">bar</span> to <span Class="emphasis">/bla/foo</span>, which is an already existing directory.  Normally (when <span Class="bold">Dive into subdirs</span> is not set), mc would copy file <span Class="emphasis">/foo/bar</span> into the file <span Class="emphasis">/bla/foo/bar</span>. By enabling this option the <span Class="emphasis">/bla/foo/foo</span> directory will be created, and <span Class="emphasis">/foo/bar</span> will be copied into <span Class="emphasis">/bla/foo/foo/bar</span>. </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">Preserve attributes</span> </p>
<p class="level0">determines whether to preserve the permissions, timestamps and (if you are root) the ownership of the original files.  If this option is not set, the current value of the umask will be respected. </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">Use shell patterns</span> </p>
<p class="level0">When this option is on you can use the &#39;*&#39; and &#39;?&#39; wildcards in the source mask. They work like they do in the shell. In the target mask only the &#39;*&#39; and &#39;&bsol;&lt;digit&gt;&#39; wildcards are allowed. The first &#39;*&#39; wildcard in the target mask corresponds to the first wildcard group in the source mask, the second &#39;*&#39; corresponds to the second group and so on.  The &#39;&bsol;1&#39; wildcard corresponds to the first wildcard group in the source mask, the &#39;&bsol;2&#39; wildcard corresponds to the second group and so on all the way up to &#39;&bsol;9&#39;. The &#39;&bsol;0&#39; wildcard is the whole filename of the source file. </p>
<p class="level0">Two examples: </p>
<p class="level0">If the source mask is &quot;*.tar.gz&quot;, the destination is &quot;/bla/*.tgz&quot; and the file to be copied is &quot;foo.tar.gz&quot;, the copy will be &quot;foo.tgz&quot; in &quot;/bla&quot;. </p>
<p class="level0">Suppose you want to swap basename and extension so that &quot;file.c&quot; would become &quot;c.file&quot; and so on.  The source mask for this is &quot;*.*&quot; and the destination is &quot;&bsol;2.&bsol;1&quot;. </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">Use shell patterns off</span> </p>
<p class="level0">When the shell patterns option is off the MC doesn&#39;t do automatic grouping anymore. You must use &#39;&bsol;(...&bsol;)&#39; expressions in the source mask to specify meaning for the wildcards in the target mask. This is more flexible but also requires more typing. Otherwise target masks are similar to the situation when the shell patterns option is on. </p>
<p class="level0">Two examples: </p>
<p class="level0">If the source mask is &quot;^&bsol;(.*&bsol;)&bsol;.tar&bsol;.gz$&quot;, the destination is &quot;/bla/*.tgz&quot; and the file to be copied is &quot;foo.tar.gz&quot;, the copy will be &quot;/bla/foo.tgz&quot;. </p>
<p class="level0">Let&#39;s suppose you want to swap basename and extension so that &quot;file.c&quot; will become &quot;c.file&quot; and so on. The source mask for this is &quot;^&bsol;(.*&bsol;)&bsol;.&bsol;(.*&bsol;)$&quot; and the destination is &quot;&bsol;2.&bsol;1&quot;. </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">Case Conversions</span> </p>
<p class="level0">You can also change the case of the filenames.  If you use &#39;&bsol;u&#39; or &#39;&bsol;l&#39; in the target mask, the next character will be converted to uppercase or lowercase correspondingly. </p>
<p class="level0">If you use &#39;&bsol;U&#39; or &#39;&bsol;L&#39; in the target mask, the next characters will be converted to uppercase or lowercase correspondingly up to the next &#39;&bsol;E&#39; or next &#39;&bsol;U&#39;, &#39;&bsol;L&#39; or the end of the file name. </p>
<p class="level0">The &#39;&bsol;u&#39; and &#39;&bsol;l&#39; are stronger than &#39;&bsol;U&#39; and &#39;&bsol;L&#39;. </p>
<p class="level0">For example, if the source mask is &#39;*&#39; ( <span Class="emphasis">Use shell patterns</span> on) or &#39;^&bsol;(.*&bsol;)$&#39; ( <span Class="emphasis">Use shell patterns</span> off) and the target mask is &#39;&bsol;L&bsol;u*&#39; the file names will be converted to have initial upper case and otherwise lower case. </p>
<p class="level0">You can also use &#39;&acute; as a quote character. For example, &#39;&bsol;&acute; is a backslash and &#39;&bsol;*&#39; is an asterisk. </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">Stable symlinks</span> </p>
<p class="level0">commands Midnight Commander, that it should change symlinks in the target, so that they&#39;ll point to the same location as it did before. With absolute symbolic links this does nothing, but if you have a relative one, it will recompute its value, adding necessary ../ and other directory parts and making the value as short as possible (most modern filesystems keep short symlinks inside inodes and thus don&#39;t waste much disk space). </p><a name="SelectUnselect"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">Select/unselect files</h2>

<p class="level0">When <span Class="emphasis">Files only</span> checkbox is on, only files will be selected.  If <span Class="emphasis">Files only</span> is off, as files as directories will be selected. When <span Class="emphasis">Shell Patterns</span> checkbox is on, the regular expression is much like the filename globbing in the shell (* standing for zero or more characters and ?  standing for one character). If <span Class="emphasis">Shell Patterns</span> is off, then the tagging of files is done with normal regular expressions (see ed (1)). When <span Class="emphasis">Case sensitive</span> checkbox is on, the selection will be case sensitive characters.

<p class="level0">The internal file viewer provides two display modes: ASCII and hex. To toggle between modes, use the F4 key. </p>
<p class="level0">The viewer will try to use the best method provided by your system or the file type to display the information. Some character sequences, which appear most often in preformatted manual pages, are displayed bold and underlined, thus making a pretty display of your files. </p>
<p class="level0">When in hex mode, the search function accepts text in quotes and constant numbers.  Text in quotes is matched exactly after removing the quotes.  Each number matches one byte.  You can mix quoted text with constants like this: </p><pre class="level0">
&quot;String&quot; 34 0xBB 012 &quot;more text&quot;
</pre>

<p class="level0">Numbers are always interpreted in hex. In the example above, &quot;34&quot; is interpreted as 0x34. The prefix &quot;0x&quot; isn&#39;t really needed: we could type &quot;BB&quot; instead of &quot;0xBB&quot;. And &quot;012&quot; is interpreted as 0x12, not as an octal number. </p>
<p class="level0">Here is a listing of the actions associated with each key that the Midnight Commander handles in the internal file viewer. </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">F1</span> Invoke the built-in hypertext help viewer. </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">F2</span> Toggle the wrap mode. </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">F4</span> Toggle the hex mode. </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">F5</span> Goto. You can specify a line number, offset or percentage of file size of position that you want to view. </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">F7, /, ?</span> Start search. These keys call the dialog window that allows you to set up the search options. If key is ? the &quot;Backwards&quot; option is on. </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">C-s</span> Continue forward search. </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">C-r</span> Continue reverse search. </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">F17, n</span> Continue search in the chosen direction. </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">N</span> Temporary change the search direction: backwards if forward search is chosen, and vice versa. </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">F8</span> Toggle Raw/Parsed mode: This will show the file as found on disk or if a processing filter has been specified in the mc.ext.ini file, then the output from the filter. Current mode is always the other than written on the button label, since on the button is the mode which you enter by that key. </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">F9</span> Toggle the format/unformat mode: when format mode is on the viewer will interpret some string sequences to show bold and underline with different colors. Also, on button label is the other mode than current. </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">F10, Esc.</span> Exit the internal file viewer. </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">PageDown, space, C-v.</span> Scroll one page forward. </p>

<p class="level0">The internal file editor is a full-featured full screen editor.  It can edit files up to 64 megabytes.  It is possible to edit binary files. The internal file editor is invoked using <span Class="bold">F4</span> if the <span Class="emphasis">use_internal_edit</span> option is set in the initialization file. </p>
<p class="level0">The features it presently supports are: block copy, move, delete, cut, paste; key for key undo; pull-down menus; file insertion; macro commands; regular expression search and replace; S-arrow text highlighting (if supported by the terminal); insert-overwrite toggle; word wrap; autoindent; tunable tab size; syntax highlighting for various file types; and an option to pipe text blocks through shell commands like indent and ispell. </p>
<p class="level0">Sections: </p>
<p class="level0"><a name=""></a><span class="nroffip"></span> </p>
<p class="level1">Options of editor in ini-file </p>
<p class="level1">The editor is very easy to use and requires no tutoring. To see what keys do what, just consult the appropriate pull-down menu. Other keys are: Shift movement keys do text highlighting. <span Class="bold">C-Ins</span> copies to the file <span Class="bold">mcedit.clip</span> and <span Class="bold">S-Ins</span> pastes from mcedit.clip. <span Class="bold">S-Del</span> cuts to <span Class="bold">mcedit.clip</span>, and <span Class="bold">C-Del</span> deletes highlighted text. Mouse highlighting also works, and you can override the mouse as usual by holding down the shift key while dragging the mouse to let normal terminal mouse highlighting work. </p>
<p class="level1">To define a macro, press <span Class="bold">C-R</span> and then type out the key strokes you want to be executed. Press <span Class="bold">C-R</span> again when finished. You can then assign the macro to any key you like by pressing that key. The macro is executed when you press <span Class="bold">C-A</span> and then the assigned key. The macro is also executed if you press Meta, Ctrl, or Esc and the assigned key, provided that the key is not used for any other function. Once defined, the macro commands go into the file <span Class="bold">~/.local/share/mc/mcedit/mcedit.macros</span> You can delete a macro by deleting the appropriate line in this file. </p>
<p class="level1">To change charset of displayed text may use Alt-e (M-e). Recoding is made from selected codepage into system codepage. To cancel the recoding you may select &quot;&lt;No translation&gt;&quot; in charset selection dialog. </p>
<p class="level1"><span Class="bold">F19</span> will format the currently highlighted block (plain text or C or C++ code or another). This is controlled by the file <span Class="bold">%pkgdatadir%/edit.indent.rc</span> which is copied to <span Class="bold">~/.local/share/mc/mcedit/edit.indent.rc</span> in your home directory the first time you use it. </p>
<p class="level1">The editor also displays non-us characters (160+). When editing binary files, you should set <span Class="bold">display bits</span> to 7 bits in the options menu to keep the spacing clean. </p><a name="Options"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">Options of editor in ini-file</h2>

<p class="level0">Midnight Commander supports running many internal modules (such as editor, viewer and diff viewer) simultaneously and switching between them without closing open files. Using several file managers at a time, however, is not currently supported. </p>
<p class="level0">Let&#39;s call each of these modules a screen. There are three ways to switch between screens, using one of these global shortcuts: </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">Alt-}</span> switch to the next screen; </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">Alt-{</span> switch to the previous screen; </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">Alt-`</span> open a dialog window with the list of currently open screens (or use the &quot;Screen list&quot; menu item). </p><a name="Completion"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">Completion</h2>
<p class="level0">Let Midnight Commander type for you. </p>
<p class="level0">Attempt to perform completion on the text before current position.  MC attempts completion treating the text as variable (if the text begins with <a class="bold" href="#">$</a>), username (if the text begins with <a class="bold" href="#">~</a>), hostname (if the text begins with <a class="bold" href="#">@</a>) or command (if you are on the command line in the position where you might type a command, possible completions then include shell reserved words and shell built-in commands as well) in turn.  If none of these matches, filename completion is attempted. </p>
<p class="level0">Filename, username, variable and hostname completion works on all input lines, command completion is command line specific.  If the completion is ambiguous (there are more different possibilities), MC beeps and the following action depends on the setting of the </p>
<p class="level0">Complete: show all </p>
<p class="level0">option in the </p>
<p class="level0">Configuration </p>
<p class="level0">dialog.  If it is enabled, a list of all possibilities pops up next to the current position and you can select with the arrow keys and <span Class="bold">Enter</span> the correct entry.  You can also type the first letters in which the possibilities differ to move to a subset of all possibilities and complete as much as possible.  If you press <span Class="bold">Alt-Tab</span> again, only the subset will be shown in the listbox, otherwise the first item which matches all the previous characters will be highlighted.  As soon as there is no ambiguity, dialog disappears, but you can hide it by canceling keys <span Class="bold">Esc</span>, <span Class="bold">F10</span> and left and right arrow keys. If </p>
<p class="level0">Complete: show all </p>
<p class="level0">is disabled, the dialog pops up only if you press <span Class="bold">Alt-Tab</span> for the second time, for the first time MC just beeps. </p>

<p class="level0">Midnight Commander is provided with a code layer to access the file system; this code layer is known as the virtual file system switch.  The virtual file system switch allows Midnight Commander to manipulate files not located on the Unix file system. </p>
<p class="level0">Currently, Midnight Commander is packaged with some Virtual File Systems (VFS): the <span Class="emphasis">local</span> file system, used for accessing the regular Unix file system; the <span Class="emphasis">ftpfs</span>, used to manipulate files on remote systems with the FTP protocol; the <span Class="emphasis">tarfs</span>, used to manipulate tar and compressed tar files; the <span Class="emphasis">undelfs</span>, used to recover deleted files on ext2 file systems (the default file system for Linux systems), <span Class="emphasis">fish</span> (for manipulating files over shell connections such as rsh and ssh). If the code was compiled with <span Class="emphasis">sftpfs</span> (for manipulating files over SFTP connections). </p>
<p class="level0">A generic <span Class="emphasis">extfs</span> (EXTernal virtual File System) is provided in order to easily expand VFS capabilities using scripts and external software. </p>
<p class="level0">The VFS switch code will interpret all of the path names used and will forward them to the correct file system, the formats used for each one of the file systems is described later in their own section. </p><a name=""></a><h2 class="nroffsh">  ftp file system</h2>
<p class="level0">The FTP File System (ftpfs) allows you to manipulate files on remote machines.  To actually use it, you can use the <span Class="emphasis">FTP link</span> item in the menu or directly change your current directory using the <span Class="emphasis">cd</span> command to a path name that looks like this: </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis"><a href="ftp://[!][user[:pass]@]machine[:port][remote-dir]">ftp://[!][user[:pass]@]machine[:port][remote-dir]</a></span> </p>
<p class="level0">The <span Class="emphasis">user</span>, <span Class="emphasis">port</span> and <span Class="emphasis">remote-dir</span> elements are optional.  If you specify the <span Class="emphasis">user</span> element, Midnight Commander will login to the remote machine as that user, otherwise it will use anonymous login or the login name from the <span Class="emphasis">~/.netrc</span> file.  The optional <span Class="emphasis">pass</span> element is the password used for the connection.  Using the password in the VFS directory name is not recommended, because it can appear on the screen in clear text and can be saved to the directory history. </p>
<p class="level0">To enable using FTP proxy, prepend <a class="bold" href="#">!</a> (an exclamation sign) to the hostname. </p>
<p class="level0">Examples: </p><pre class="level0">
&nbsp;   ftp://ftp.nuclecu.unam.mx/linux/local
&nbsp;   ftp://tsx-11.mit.edu/pub/linux/packages
&nbsp;   ftp://!behind.firewall.edu/pub

<p class="level0">dialog box for ftpfs options. </p><a name=""></a><h2 class="nroffsh">  tar file system</h2>
<p class="level0">The tar file system provides you with read-only access to your tar files and compressed tar files by using the chdir command.  To change your directory to a tar file, you change your current directory to the tar file by using the following syntax: </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">/filename.tar/utar://[dir-inside-tar]</span> </p>
<p class="level0">The mc.ext.ini file already provides a shortcut for tar files, this means that usually you just point to a tar file and press return to enter into the tar file, see the </p>
<p class="level0">Edit Extension File </p>
<p class="level0">section for details on how this is done. </p>
<p class="level0">Examples: </p><pre class="level0">
&nbsp;   mc-3.0.tar.gz/utar://mc-3.0/vfs
&nbsp;   /ftp/GCC/gcc-2.7.0.tar/utar://
</pre>

<p class="level0">The latter specifies the full path of the tar archive. </p><a name=""></a><h2 class="nroffsh">  file transfer over shell filesystem</h2>
<p class="level0">The fish file system is a network based file system that allows you to manipulate the files in a remote machine as if they were local. To use this, the other side has to either run fish server, or has to have bash-compatible shell. </p>
<p class="level0">To connect to a remote machine, you just need to chdir into a special directory which name is in the following format: </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">sh://[user@]machine[:options]/[remote-dir]</span> </p>
<p class="level0">The <span Class="emphasis">user,</span> <span Class="emphasis">options</span> and <span Class="emphasis">remote-dir</span> elements are optional.  If you specify the <span Class="emphasis">user</span> element, Midnight Commander will try to login on the remote machine as that user, otherwise it will use your login name. </p>
<p class="level0">The available <span Class="emphasis">options</span> are: </p><pre class="level0">
&nbsp; &#39;C&#39; - use compression;
&nbsp; &#39;r&#39; - use rsh instead of ssh;
&nbsp; port - specify the port used by remote server.
</pre>

<p class="level0">If the <span Class="emphasis">remote-dir</span> element is present, your current directory on the remote machine will be set to this one. </p>
<p class="level0">Examples: </p><pre class="level0">
&nbsp;   sh://onlyrsh.mx:r/linux/local
&nbsp;   sh://joe@want.compression.edu:C/private

<p class="level0">The SFTP file system is a network based file system that allows you to manipulate the files in a remote machine as if they were local. </p>
<p class="level0">To connect to a remote machine, you just need to chdir into a special directory which name is in the following format: </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">sftp://[user@]machine:[port]/[remote-dir]</span> </p>
<p class="level0">The <span Class="emphasis">user,</span> <span Class="emphasis">port</span> and <span Class="emphasis">remote-dir</span> elements are optional.  If you specify the <span Class="emphasis">user</span> element, Midnight Commander will try to login on the remote machine as that user, otherwise it will use your login name. <span Class="emphasis">port</span> - specify the port used by remote server (22 by default). If the <span Class="emphasis">remote-dir</span> element is present, your current directory on the remote machine will be set to this one. </p>
<p class="level0">Examples: </p><pre class="level0">
&nbsp;   sftp://onlyrsh.mx/linux/local
&nbsp;   sftp://joe:password@want.compression.edu/private

&nbsp;   sftp://joe@somehost.ssh.edu:2222/private
</pre>

<p class="level0">When establishing the connection, server key fingerprint is verified using the ~/.ssh/known_hosts file. If the host/key pair is not found or the host is found, but the key doesn&#39;t match, an appropriate message is shown. There are three buttons in the message dialog: </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">[Yes]</span> add new host/key pair to the ~/.ssh/known_hosts file and continue. </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">[Ignore]</span> do not add new host/key pair to the ~/.ssh/known_hosts file, but continue nevertheless (at you own risk). </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">[No]</span> abort connection. </p><a name=""></a><h2 class="nroffsh">  undelete file system</h2>
<p class="level0">On Linux systems, if you asked configure to use the ext2fs undelete facilities, you will have the undelete file system available. Recovery of deleted files is only available on ext2 file systems.  The undelete file system is just an interface to the ext2fs library to retrieve all of the deleted files names on an ext2fs and provides and to extract the selected files into a regular partition. </p>
<p class="level0">To use this file system, you have to chdir into the special file name formed by the &quot;undel://&quot; prefix and the file name where the actual file system resides. </p>
<p class="level0">For example, to recover deleted files on the second partition of the first SCSI disk on Linux, you would use the following path name: </p><pre class="level0">
&nbsp;   undel://sda2
</pre>

<p class="level0">It may take a while for the undelfs to load the required information before you start browsing files there. </p><a name=""></a><h2 class="nroffsh">  external file system</h2>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">extfs</span> allows you to integrate numerous features and file types into GNU Midnight Commander in an easy way, by writing scripts. </p>
<p class="level0">Extfs filesystems can be divided into two categories: </p>
<p class="level0">1. Stand-alone filesystems, which are not associated with any existing file.  They represent certain system-wide data as a directory tree. You can invoke them by typing <span Class="emphasis">cd fsname://</span> where fsname is an extfs short name (see below).  Examples of such filesystems include audio (list audio tracks on the CD) or apt (list of all Debian packages in the system). </p>
<p class="level0">For example, to list CD-Audio tracks on your CD-ROM drive, type </p><pre class="level0">
&nbsp; cd audio://
</pre>

<p class="level0">2. &#39;Archive&#39; filesystems (like rpm, patchfs and more), which represent contents of a file as a directory tree.  It can consist of &#39;real&#39; files compressed in an archive (urar, rpm) or virtual files, like messages in a mailbox (mailfs) or parts of a patch (patchfs).  To access such filesystems <span Class="emphasis">fsname://</span> should be appended to the archive name.  Note that the archive itself can be on another vfs. </p>
<p class="level0">For example, to list contents of a zip archive documents.zip type </p><pre class="level0">
&nbsp; cd documents.zip/uzip://
</pre>

<p class="level0">In many aspects, you could treat extfs like any other directory.  For instance, you can add it to the hotlist or change to it from directory history.  An important limitation is that you cannot invoke shell commands inside extfs, just like any other non-local VFS. </p>
<p class="level0">Common extfs scripts included with Midnight Commander are: </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">a</span> access &#39;A:&#39; DOS/Windows diskette (<span Class="emphasis">cd a://</span>). </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">apt</span> front end to Debian&#39;s APT package management system (<span Class="emphasis">cd apt://</span>). </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">audio</span> audio CD ripping and playing (<span Class="emphasis">cd audio://</span> or <span Class="emphasis">cd device/audio://</span>). </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">bpp</span> package of Bad Penguin GNU/Linux distribution (<span Class="emphasis">cd file.bpp/bpp://</span>). </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="bold">deb</span> package of Debian GNU/Linux distribution (<span Class="emphasis">cd file.deb/deb://</span>). </p>

<a name="Colors"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">Colors</h2>
<p class="level0">Midnight Commander will try to detect if your terminal supports color using the terminal database and your terminal name.  Sometimes it gets confused, so you may force color mode or disable color mode using the -c and -b flag respectively. </p>
<p class="level0">If the program is compiled with the S-Lang screen manager instead of ncurses, it will also check the variable <span Class="bold">COLORTERM,</span> if it is set, it has the same effect as the -c flag. </p>
<p class="level0">You may specify terminals that always force color mode by adding the <span Class="emphasis">color_terminals</span> variable to the Colors section of the initialization file.  This will prevent Midnight Commander from trying to detect if your terminal supports color.  Example: </p><pre class="level0">
[Colors]
color_terminals=linux,xterm
color_terminals=terminal-name1,terminal-name2...
</pre>

<p class="level0">The program can be compiled with both ncurses and S-Lang, ncurses does not provide a way to force color mode: ncurses uses just the information in the terminal database. </p>
<p class="level0">Midnight Commander provides a way to change the default colors. Currently the colors are configured using the environment variable <span Class="bold">MC_COLOR_TABLE</span> or the Colors section in the initialization file. </p>
<p class="level0">In the Colors section, the default color map is loaded from the <span Class="emphasis">base_color</span> variable.  You can specify an alternate color map for a terminal by using the terminal name as the key in this section.  Example: </p><pre class="level0">
[Colors]
base_color=
xterm=menu=magenta:marked=,magenta:markselect=,red
</pre>

<p class="level0">The format for the color definition is: </p><pre class="level0">
&nbsp; &lt;keyword&gt;=&lt;fgcolor&gt;,&lt;bgcolor&gt;,&lt;attributes&gt;:&lt;keyword&gt;=...
</pre>

<p class="level0">The colors are optional, and the keywords are: normal, selected, disabled, marked, markselect, errors, input, inputmark, inputunchanged, commandlinemark, reverse, gauge, header, inputhistory, commandhistory. Button bar colors are: bbarhotkey, bbarbutton. Status bar color: statusbar. Menu colors are: menunormal, menusel, menuhot, menuhotsel, menuinactive. Dialog colors are: dnormal, dfocus, dhotnormal, dhotfocus, dtitle. Error dialog colors are: errdfocus, errdhotnormal, errdhotfocus, errdtitle.  Help colors are: helpnormal, helpitalic, helpbold, helplink, helpslink, helptitle.  Viewer colors are: viewnormal, viewbold, viewunderline, viewselected. Editor colors are: editnormal, editbold, editmarked, editwhitespace, editlinestate. Popup menu colors are: pmenunormal, pmenusel, pmenutitle. </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">header</span> determines the color of panel header, the line that contains column titles and sort mode indicator. </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">input</span> determines the color of input lines used in query dialogs. </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">gauge</span> determines the color of the filled part of the progress bar (gauge), which is used to show the user the progress of file operations, such as copying. </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">disabled</span> determines the color of the widget that cannot be selected. </p>
<p class="level0">The dialog boxes use the following colors: <span Class="emphasis">dnormal</span> is used for the normal text, <span Class="emphasis">dfocus</span> is the color used for the currently selected component, <span Class="emphasis">dhotnormal</span> is the color used to differentiate the hotkey color in normal components, whereas the <span Class="emphasis">dhotfocus</span> color is used for the highlighted color in the currently selected component. </p>
<p class="level0">Menus use the same scheme but uses the menunormal, menusel, menuhot, menuhotsel and menuinactive tags instead. </p>
<p class="level0">Help uses the following colors: <span Class="emphasis">helpnormal</span> is used for normal text, <span Class="emphasis">helpitalic</span> is used for text which is emphasized in italic in the manual page, <span Class="emphasis">helpbold</span> is used for text which is emphasized in bold in the manual page, <span Class="emphasis">helplink</span> is used for not selected hyperlinks and <span Class="emphasis">helpslink</span> is used for selected hyperlink. </p>
<p class="level0">Popup menu uses following colors: <span Class="emphasis">pmenunormal</span> is used for non-selected menu items and as a main color of popup menu window, <span Class="emphasis">pmenusel</span> is used for selected menu item, <span Class="emphasis">pmenutitle</span> is used for popup menu title. </p>
<p class="level0">The possible colors are: black, gray, red, brightred, green, brightgreen, brown, yellow, blue, brightblue, magenta, brightmagenta, cyan, brightcyan, lightgray and white. And there is a special keyword for transparent background. It is &#39;default&#39;. The &#39;default&#39; can only be used for background color. Another special keyword &quot;base&quot; means mc&#39;s main colors.  When 256 colors are available, they can be specified either as color16 to color255, or as rgb000 to rgb555 and gray0 to gray23. Example: </p><pre class="level0">
[Colors]
base_color=normal=white,default:marked=magenta,default
</pre>

<p class="level0">Attributes can be any of bold, italic, underline, reverse and blink, appended by a plus sign if more than one are desired.  The special word &quot;none&quot; means no attributes, without attempting to fall back to base_color.  Example: </p><pre class="level0">
menuhotsel=yellow;black;bold+underline

<a name="Special"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">Special settings</h2>
<p class="level0">Most of Midnight Commander settings can be changed from the menus. However, there are a small number of settings which can only be changed by editing the setup file. </p>
<p class="level0">These variables may be set in your ~/.config/mc/ini file: </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">clear_before_exec</span> By default, Midnight Commander clears the screen before executing a command.  If you would prefer to see the output of the command at the bottom of the screen, edit your ~/.config/mc/ini file and change the value of the field clear_before_exec to 0. </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">confirm_view_dir</span> If you press F3 on a directory, normally MC enters that directory.  If this flag is set to 1, then MC will ask for confirmation before changing the directory if you have files tagged. </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">ftpfs_retry_seconds</span> This value is the number of seconds Midnight Commander will wait before attempting to reconnect to an FTP server that has denied the login.  If the value is zero, the login will no be retried. </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">max_dirt_limit</span> Specifies how many screen updates can be skipped at most in the internal file viewer.  Normally this value is not significant, because the code automatically adjusts the number of updates to skip according to the rate of incoming keystrokes.  However, on very slow machines or terminals with a fast keyboard auto repeat, a big value can make screen updates too jumpy. </p>
<p class="level0"><a name=""></a><span class="nroffip"></span> </p>
<p class="level1">It seems that setting max_dirt_limit to 10 causes the best behavior, and that is the default value. </p>
<p class="level1"><span Class="emphasis">mouse_move_pages_viewer</span> Controls if scrolling with the mouse is done by pages or line by line on the internal file viewer. </p>
<p class="level1"><span Class="emphasis">only_leading_plus_minus</span> Allow special treatment for &#39;+&#39;, &#39;-&#39;, &#39;*&#39; in the command line (select, unselect, reverse selection) only if the command line is empty.  You don&#39;t need to quote those characters in the middle of the command line. On the other hand, you cannot use them to change selection when the command line is not empty. </p>
<p class="level1"><span Class="emphasis">alternate_plus_minus</span> If true, use &#39;+&#39;, &#39;-&#39;, &#39;&acute; and &#39;*&#39; keys normally. For select/unselect, use &#39;Alt-+&#39;, &#39;Alt--&#39; and &#39;Alt-*&#39;. </p>
<p class="level1"><span Class="emphasis">show_output_starts_shell</span> This variable only works if you are not using the subshell support. When you use the C-o keystroke to go back to the user screen, if this one is set, you will get a fresh shell.  Otherwise, pressing any key will bring you back to Midnight Commander. </p>
<p class="level1"><span Class="emphasis">timeformat_recent</span> Change the time format used to display dates less than 6 months from now. See strftime or date man page for the format specification. If this option is absent, default timeformat is used. </p>
<p class="level1"><span Class="emphasis">timeformat_old</span> Change the time format used to display  dates older than 6 months from now or for dates in the future. See strftime or date man page for the format specification. If this option is absent, default timeformat is used. </p>
<p class="level1"><span Class="emphasis">torben_fj_mode</span> If this flag is set, then the home and end keys will work slightly different on the panels, instead of moving the selection to the first and last files in the panels, they will act as follows: </p>
<p class="level0"><a name=""></a><span class="nroffip"></span> </p>
<p class="level1">The home key will: Go up to the middle line, if below it; else go to the top line unless it is already on the top line, in this case it will go to the first file in the panel. </p>
<p class="level0"><a name=""></a><span class="nroffip"></span> </p>
<p class="level1">The end key has a similar behavior: Go down to the middle line, if over it; else go to the bottom line unless you already are at the bottom line, in such case it will move the selection to the last file name in the panel. </p>
<p class="level1"><span Class="emphasis">use_file_to_guess_type</span> If this variable is on (the default) it will spawn the file command to match the file types listed on the </p>
<p class="level1">mc.ext.ini file. </p>
<p class="level1"><span Class="emphasis">xtree_mode</span> If this variable is on (default is off) when you browse the file system on a Tree panel, it will automatically reload the other panel with the contents of the selected directory. </p>
<p class="level1"><span Class="emphasis">fish_directory_timeout</span> This variable holds the lifetime of a directory cache entry in seconds. The default value is 900 seconds. </p>
<p class="level1"><span Class="emphasis">clipboard_store</span> This variable contains path (with options) to the external clipboard utility like &#39;xclip&#39; to read text into X selection from file. For example: </p><pre class="level1">
clipboard_store=xclip -i
</pre>

<p class="level1"><span Class="emphasis">clipboard_paste</span> This variable contains path (with options) to the external clipboard utility like &#39;xclip&#39; to print the selection to standard out. For example: </p><pre class="level1">
clipboard_paste=xclip -o
</pre>

<p class="level1"><span Class="emphasis">autodetect_codeset</span> This option allows use the `enca&#39; command to autodetect codeset of text files in internal viewer and editor. List of valid values can be obtain by the `enca --list languages | cut -d : -f1&#39; command. Option must be located in the [Misc] section. </p>
<p class="level1">For example: </p><pre class="level1">

</pre>
<a name="Parameters"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">Parameters for external editor or viewer</h2>
<p class="level0">Midnight Commander provides a way for specify an options for external editors and viewers. Midnight Commander tries to search the &quot;[External editor or viewer parameters]&quot; section in the system initialization file (the mc.lib file located in Midnight Commander&#39;s library directory) and then in the ~/.config/mc/ini file. The option name should be equal to the name (full pathname) of external editor or viewer. The option value can contain following variables: </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">%filename</span> The filename to edit/view. </p>
<p class="level0"><span Class="emphasis">%lineno</span> The start line in the opening file. </p>
<p class="level0">For example: </p><pre class="level0">
[External editor or viewer parameters]
&nbsp;   vi=%filename +%lineno
&nbsp;   joe=%filename +%lineno
&nbsp;   more=%filename +%lineno
</pre>

<p class="level0">Start line is passed to the external editor/viewer only if it is called from the </p>
<p class="level0">Find file </p>
<p class="level0">results window. </p>
<p class="level0">If external editor/viewer is launched via F4/F3 keys, MC hopes that program (at least &quot;joe&quot;, but probably others too) has an own feature that by default opens the file where it was last open. MC doesn&#39;t prevent external editor/viewer to save and restore position in opened files. </p><a name="Terminal"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">Terminal databases</h2>
<p class="level0">Midnight Commander provides a way to fix your system terminal database without requiring root privileges. Midnight Commander searches in the system initialization file (the mc.lib file located in Midnight Commander&#39;s library directory) and in the  ~/.config/mc/ini file for the section  &quot;terminal:your-terminal-name&quot; and then for the section &quot;terminal:general&quot;, each line of the section contains a key symbol that you want to define, followed by an equal sign and the definition for the key.  You can use the special &bsol; form to represent the escape character and the ^x to represent the control-x character. </p>
<p class="level0">The possible key symbols are: </p><pre class="level0">
f0 to f20     Function keys f0-f20
bs            backspace
home          home key
end           end key
up            up arrow key
down          down arrow key
left          left arrow key
right         right arrow key
pgdn          page down key
pgup          page up key
insert        the insert character
delete        the delete character
complete      to do completion
</pre>

<p class="level0">For example, to define the key insert to be the Escape + [ + O + p, you set this in the ini file: </p><pre class="level0">
insert=&bsol;[Op
</pre>

<p class="level0">Also now you can use <span Class="emphasis">extended learn keys.</span> For example: </p><pre class="level0">
&nbsp;   ctrl-alt-right=&bsol;[[1;6C
&nbsp;   ctrl-alt-left=&bsol;[[1;6D
</pre>

<p class="level0">This means that ctrl+alt+left sends a &bsol;[[1;6D escape sequence and therefore Midnight Commander interprets &quot;&bsol;[[1;6D&quot; as C-Alt-Left. </p>
<p class="level0">The <span Class="emphasis">complete</span> key symbol represents the escape sequences used to invoke the completion process, this is invoked with Alt-tab, but you can define other keys to do the same work (on those keyboard with tons of nice and unused keys everywhere). </p><a name=""></a><h2 class="nroffsh"></h2><a name="FILES"></a><h2 class="nroffsh">Files</h2>
