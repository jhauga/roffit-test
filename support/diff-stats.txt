<p>The files tested are the number of files that were used for test. These files at the very least will be doubled relative to files built.</p>
<p><strong>Total Files Tested</strong>  - 30</p>
<p><strong>Tested Files with Differences</strong> - 6</p>
<p><h3 style="display:inline">File Difference Percentage</h3> - 20</p>

<p>The files built account for files tested (x1) for source and pull (x2) for options (xUsed).</p>
<p><small>built = (optonCount x filesTested) * 2 (<em>source and pull repo)</em> ---
So--- optonCount = 2 ; filesTested= 30;  repos = 2;</small></p>
<p><strong>Total Files Built</strong>  - 120</p>
<p><strong>Total Files with Differences</strong> - 24</p>
